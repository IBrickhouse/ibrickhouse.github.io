    <p>My whole life traveling around the world was one of the things I had always wanted to do.</p>
    <p>I dreamed of visiting countries all over Asia like Japan and Korea but I was never given the opportunity to.</p>
    <p>Early this year, March 2025, I was given the chance to fulfill this dream of traveling abroad and fell in love even more with not only the countries I visited;</p>
    <br>
    <p>I fell even deeper in love with my beautiful girlfriend Callie.</p>
    <br>

    <p>This was the greatest experience of my whole life and kickstarted my goal of living and working in this new place I hope to call home one day. </p>
