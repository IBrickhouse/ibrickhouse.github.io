    <p>Gaming is a portion of my life that I value greatly. I don't have the largest collection of games, but it is larger than most.</p>
    <p>I started playing when I was young on my Grandpa's original Game Boy which greww into a love of gaming as I got older.</p>
    <p>The first game I remember falling in love with was Pokemon Blue (I got the game as a hand me down from my cousin)
    and ever since then I have been a gamer buying every system and game I wanted so I would never miss out on a title. (I feel bad for my parents having to support this interest)</p>
    <p>On this page I wanted to show off my collection as well as showing the tools I built to track my gaming adventures.</p>
    <H1>Coming soon!</H1>
