    <p>I always liked sports but was never very good at them myself, so I have always enjoyed watching them instead.</p>
    <p>In my hometown of Rapid City, South Dakota we have an ECHL ice hockey team called the Rapid City Rush and as a kid we went to those games very often.</p>
    <p>Growing up watching Hockey, I fell in love with the sport but after moving to Oregon, there were very few options to watch.</p>
    <p>Then, in 2021, Seattle, Washington got a NHL team called the Seattle Kraken and they became my team. I have been a huge fan since day 1 and I am very excited for them to grow as a team.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Having already known the rules of hockey, I already had a sense for the game.</p>
    <p>However, with a new team new fans came into the sport and I saw a lot of confusion among them. I decided to wanted to make something to help.</p>
    <p>The project is still in the development stages, so I hope you will come back soon and see the progress!</p>
