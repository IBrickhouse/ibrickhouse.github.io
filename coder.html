    <p>My whole life, I have dreamed of being a software developer following after my dad who was also a developer.</p>
    <p>I began my journey after high school at South Dakota School of Mines and Technlogy and eventually went to </p>
    <p>Central Oregon Community College and Oregon State University Cascades for my Associates and Bachelors Degrees.</p>
    <p>I have so many projects that it is impossible to talk about all of them, so the best way to see them is to share my</p>
    <a href="github.com/ibrickhouse"> GitHub profile.</a></p>
    <p>I hope you will find something interesting!</p>
